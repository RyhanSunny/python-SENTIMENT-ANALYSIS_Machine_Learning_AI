# python-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS_Machine_Learning_AI
Building our own Twitter Sentiment Analyzer in Python, this script will use twitter to understand how people are feeling about a topic that WE choose using the NATURAL LANGUAGE LIBRARY TEXTBLOB.  
It will be able to search twitter for a list of tweets about any topic we want, then analyze each tweet to see how positive or negative it's emotion is.
